- [ ] I did not test it but I have a good reason.. (please let me know below :smile:)

<!-- Since it is hard to write great tests around some of the action's functionality - I do not expect every PR to have 100% test coverage if it does not make sense. However, if you have no tests, the next best thing is to create an example repo, point the action to your branch, and show that your fix does address the problem. -->
